# PathPlanningAStar

### This is the repo of my first assignment of the Perspectives in Informatics 3 class.

In this assigment I implemented the A* path search algorithm. 

As a reference for my code I used explanations from this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/

## Contents

1. The A* algorithm
2. Multiple runs of the algorithm
3. Conclusion
4. Extra content

## 1. The A* algorithm

## 2. Multiple runs of the algorithm

To run the code, simply type
'''
python3 aStarPython.py 
'''

### 2.1 No weights near barriers, using manhatan distance
### 2.2 With weights near barriers, using manhatan distance
### 2.3 With weights near bassiers, using diagonal distance

## 3. Conclusion

## 4. Extra content
